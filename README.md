# Vex Spin Up (with Odometry)
 ##### This is blue team side code for the Vex robotics competition. 
***Disclaimer**: the second half of the project is coded in python and the other is converted from blocks so the structure is not very efficient.*

Huge Credits to BLRS and their documentation which explains the process of creating this code: https://wiki.purduesigbots.com/software/odometry
